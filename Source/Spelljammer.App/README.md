# Spelljammer.App source briefing

`Spelljammer.App` is the Windows x64 .NET 10 WPF executable and the current
application entry point. It owns window lifetime, presentation orchestration,
and the narrow managed/native bridge to SpriteForge. Authoritative gameplay,
settings persistence, and localization behavior remain in their respective
game-owned class libraries.

This briefing covers authored project and source files. Generated `bin/` and
`obj/` files are build output and are not part of the source inventory.

## Current startup path

```text
App.OnStartup
  -> load GameSettingsRegistry on a worker thread
  -> load embedded menu/settings catalogs through GameText
  -> create MainMenuWindow
       -> SpriteForgeMainMenuView
            -> New Game     -> CharacterCreationScreen
                                  -> SpriteForgeCharacterCreationView
            -> Game Settings -> GameSettingsDialog
                                  -> SpriteForgeSettingsView
                                  -> GameSettingsRegistry.Apply
            -> Quit Game     -> Application.Shutdown
```

The application currently opens the main menu. The earlier expedition window
and renderer viewport remain in the project as prototype code, but no current
menu action constructs them.

## File inventory

### Project root

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Spelljammer.App.csproj` | Declares the WPF `WinExe`, .NET 10 Windows target, x64 platform, application `VersionPrefix`, project references, embedded localization catalogs, and the packaged main-menu background. Its pre-compile target builds the `menu` and `settings` source catalogs into bounded `.sfloc` artifacts. Setting `CopySpriteForgeNativeRuntime` activates the repository-level target that copies SpriteForge DLLs from `SpriteForgeNativeDir`. |
| `App.xaml` | Declares the WPF application type and application resource scope. It deliberately has no `StartupUri`; startup is orchestrated in code so settings can be loaded before a window is published. |
| `App.xaml.cs` | The executable startup boundary. It temporarily uses explicit shutdown mode, resolves the per-user settings path, loads the settings registry away from the UI thread, loads localized application text, creates `MainMenuWindow`, and then makes that window the normal shutdown owner. |
| `AssemblyInfo.cs` | Configures WPF theme-resource lookup. There is no theme-specific dictionary; fallback resources are resolved from the source assembly. |

### `Hosting/`

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `MainMenuWindow.cs` | Current maximized top-level window and application flow coordinator. It owns the shared settings registry, settings path, and `GameText`; reads the display version from assembly metadata; hosts `SpriteForgeMainMenuView`; adds character-creation or settings overlays to the same visual tree; forwards status to the menu; shuts down on Quit; and detaches/disposes the views when closed. |
| `CharacterCreationScreen.cs` | In-window modal host for `SpriteForgeCharacterCreationView`. It supplies the menu-blocking scrim, scales the fixed logical surface down for smaller windows, forwards completion/cancellation, and owns deterministic cleanup. |
| `GameSettingsDialog.cs` | In-window WPF overlay around `SpriteForgeSettingsView`. Its scrim blocks the menu without creating another operating-system window. It starts settings publication on a worker thread, prevents duplicate Apply operations and closure during a write, reports failures without replacing active settings, and emits completion only after successful durable publication. |
| `MainWindow.xaml` | Retained expedition-prototype layout. It defines resource/fuel/hull displays, movement and voyage commands, an `EngineViewport`, and renderer playback controls. Most of its player-visible strings predate the current localization boundary. This window is not reachable from the current main menu. |
| `MainWindow.xaml.cs` | Retained expedition-prototype coordinator. It owns an `ExpeditionSimulation` and current `ExpeditionState`, converts button clicks into typed commands, presents sector/resource results, controls the renderer animation, and can open the shared settings dialog. It is currently inactive because startup creates `MainMenuWindow` instead. |

### `Presentation/`

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `CharacterCreationChoices.cs` | Bounded application presentation mapping for the 11 authored first-voyage character, Race, Heritage, and shared Background stable IDs. A confirmed selection also carries the explicit voyage seed; it is not yet an authoritative campaign record. |
| `GameText.cs` | Application localization facade. It reads the embedded `en-US`, `fr-FR`, and `zh-Hant-TW` menu/settings/creation artifacts with size bounds, stages a selected locale and explicit fallback transactionally, supports live locale publication, begins formatting frames, and exposes helpers for static text, option names, formatted values, percentages, and stable diagnostics. |
| `SpriteForgeCharacterCreationView.cs` | Character-creation surface on a 1100x680 logical canvas. SpriteForge owns its modal tree, five-button focus order, hit testing, pointer/keyboard actions, and copied presentation. WPF draws the captain monogram and localized captain, lineage, heritage, Background, summary, and explicit seed. Previous/Next cycles the bounded authored templates, Reroll replaces the draft seed, Escape/Back cancels, and Confirm emits a copied selection. |
| `SpriteForgeMainMenuView.cs` | Current mouse-only main-menu surface. It loads the packaged `Background.png`, draws it edge-to-edge with aspect-preserving cover scaling, and uses a fixed 1280x720 logical UI canvas. Menu grouping and button fills are transparent, leaving localized New Game, Game Settings, and Quit Game labels, the bottom-right application version, and a pointer-hover outline. SpriteForge owns retained elements, pointer hit testing, input processing, and action generation; WPF realizes copied presentation commands, localized text, and the outline. The view does not forward keyboard navigation or activation, emits only stable top-level actions, keeps bounded element/action buffers, and releases its native UI context deterministically. |
| `SpriteForgeSettingsView.cs` | Interactive settings surface and draft editor on a 900x650 logical canvas. It defines SpriteForge General, Audio, and Interface category pages; modal language/resolution option menus; sliders; toggles; buttons; focus behavior; and accessibility names. Native actions update an immutable draft profile or emit Apply/Cancel events; WPF draws the copied presentation, value labels, focus outlines, and status messages. Reset reconstructs the native document from defaults. |
| `EngineViewport.cs` | Retained expedition renderer host. It derives from `HwndHost`, creates a child Win32 window, checks SpriteForge rendering ABI v1, creates a renderer and an in-memory RGBA sprite sheet, submits bounded sprite draws, and advances a four-frame animation with a WPF render-priority timer. It owns and destroys the native texture, renderer, and child window. It is only used by the inactive `MainWindow`. |

### `Interop/`

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `SpriteForgeNative.cs` | Sole low-level SpriteForge P/Invoke boundary for this application. It mirrors renderer and UI status values, blittable camera/draw/UI structures, input/action/snapshot/presentation types, and the C ABI entry points used by the views. Its static initializer verifies managed UI structure sizes before the first native call. Ownership stays with the calling view: renderer and UI handles must be destroyed on their owner thread, copied arrays are bounded, and no native pointer enters game or save state. |

## Runtime and ownership boundaries

| Concern | Owner in the current application |
| --- | --- |
| WPF startup and window lifetime | `App`, `MainMenuWindow`, `GameSettingsDialog` |
| Main-menu and settings interaction state | SpriteForge UI documents, accessed through `SpriteForgeNative` |
| Raster/text realization | WPF drawing in the two SpriteForge view adapters |
| Localized menu/settings text | `GameText` over `Spelljammer.Localization` |
| Active settings and durable publication | `Spelljammer.Settings` through `GameSettingsRegistry` |
| Authoritative expedition state | `Spelljammer.Simulation`, currently hosted only by inactive prototype code |
| Native sprite rendering | SpriteForge through `EngineViewport`, currently inactive |

The WPF views translate physical pointer coordinates into their logical canvas,
send copied input records to SpriteForge, consume bounded action arrays, and
then invalidate their WPF rendering. They never use translated labels as
command identity: stable numeric keys identify controls, while localized text
is presentation and accessibility data.

## Build-time inputs outside this directory

`Spelljammer.App.csproj` deliberately links rather than duplicates these files:

- `Content/Packs/base/Assets/UI/MainMenu/Background.png` becomes the WPF pack
  resource `Assets/UI/MainMenu/Background.png`.
- `Content/Packs/base/Localization/en-US/menu.sfloc.json` is compiled and
  embedded as `Spelljammer.Localization.en-US.menu.sfloc`.
- `Content/Packs/base/Localization/en-US/settings.sfloc.json` is compiled and
  embedded as `Spelljammer.Localization.en-US.settings.sfloc`.
- `Content/Packs/base/Localization/en-US/creation.sfloc.json` is compiled and
  embedded as `Spelljammer.Localization.en-US.creation.sfloc`.
- The corresponding `fr-FR/menu.sfloc.json` and `fr-FR/settings.sfloc.json`
  catalogs are compiled and embedded for the installed French locale.
- The corresponding `zh-Hant-TW/menu.sfloc.json` and
  `zh-Hant-TW/settings.sfloc.json` catalogs are compiled and embedded for the
  installed Traditional Chinese locale.
- The corresponding French and Traditional Chinese `creation.sfloc.json`
  catalogs are compiled and embedded for both translated locales.
- SpriteForge native DLLs come from the configurable `SpriteForgeNativeDir`;
  no developer-specific absolute engine path belongs in the project.

## Where changes belong

- Add or change top-level window flow under `Hosting/`.
- Add WPF realization or game-specific UI adapters under `Presentation/`.
- Extend `SpriteForgeNative.cs` only for a deliberate, versioned public
  SpriteForge C ABI addition.
- Put reusable rendering, platform, input, or UI capabilities in SpriteForge,
  not in this application project.
- Put settings validation/storage, localization runtime behavior, and gameplay
  simulation in their existing class libraries rather than in a window.
- Add player-visible menu or settings wording to the authored localization
  catalogs, not as presentation literals.
