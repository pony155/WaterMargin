# Spelljammer.Content

This project owns bounded filesystem discovery, strict JSON parsing, pack
ordering, source validation and linking, immutable snapshot compilation,
semantic fingerprinting, diagnostics, and transactional publication. It
references `Spelljammer.Simulation`, which owns stable gameplay ID wrappers and
immutable runtime definition types. Simulation never references this project
and performs no filesystem work.

Milestone 2 additionally provides typed Attribute and Skill registries whose
dense indices are scoped to one fingerprint, required `en-US` key validation,
and a headless inspection snapshot used by the offline `report` command.
Milestone 3 registers Character, Background, Heritage, and Technique schemas,
links bounded grant graphs, and exposes typed registries through the
simulation-owned character catalog interface. Character creation and action
rules remain in `Spelljammer.Simulation`; `RosterInspection` is a read-only,
localization-ready presentation projection.
Milestone 4 adds strict Spell and psychic-technique definitions, expanded
training-project contracts, fingerprint-scoped registries, and validation for
supernatural access, knowledge, targets, resources, consent, resistance, and
bounded effects.

Public namespaces are:

- `Spelljammer.Content` for versioned limits;
- `Spelljammer.Content.Compilation` for compilation results, snapshots,
  registry publication, fingerprints, and roster inspection;
- `Spelljammer.Content.Diagnostics` for bounded structured failures;
- `Spelljammer.Content.Manifests` for semantic versions and manifest contracts;
  and
- `Spelljammer.Content.Sources` for explicitly configured pack roots.

The related `Spelljammer.Simulation.Content` namespace contains the validated
stable-ID wrappers and immutable definitions that may cross into authoritative
gameplay. It has no loader or filesystem dependency.

`GameContentCompiler` builds an entire candidate before returning a snapshot.
`GameContentRegistry` publishes only successful candidates, so callers can
retain the prior snapshot after any content or I/O failure.
